# Computed Tomography Project

This repository contains MATLAB code and documentation for implementing computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction techniques.

## Features
- Sinogram generation
- Back-projection reconstruction
- Filtered Back Projection (FBP)
- Fourier Interpolation (FI) reconstruction
- Subsampled and oversampled reconstruction

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run `CTAssignment_Ayush_Mall.m` to generate images.
3. Output images will be displayed and saved under the `images/` folder.

## Project Report
For a detailed explanation, refer to [CT_Project_Report-Ayush_Mall.pdf](CT_Project_Report-Ayush_Mall.pdf).
